# take-me-home

A lightweight toolkit for evaluating ferry travel plans. The package scores
candidate itineraries using tunable weights, surfaces the key factors that drive
those scores, and leaves room to incorporate future signals such as weather
alerts or reservation availability.

## Usage

```python
from datetime import datetime

from take_me_home import (
    FerryOption,
    FutureContext,
    ReservationAvailability,
    ScoringWeights,
    TravelPlan,
    WeatherDisruption,
    build_explanation,
    score_plan,
)

ferry = FerryOption(
    name="Evening Sailing",
    departure=datetime(2025, 10, 21, 17, 30),
    arrival=datetime(2025, 10, 21, 19, 0),
    risk=0.3,
    buffer_minutes=15,
)

plan = TravelPlan(
    driving_minutes_pre=50,
    driving_minutes_post=25,
    ferry=ferry,
    prep_buffer_minutes=20,
    arrival_buffer_minutes=10,
    future_context=FutureContext(
        weather=WeatherDisruption(severity=4, expected_delay_minutes=10),
        reservation=ReservationAvailability(status="limited", confidence=0.6),
    ),
)

weights = ScoringWeights().tuned(ferry_risk=0.2, weather_disruption=0.05)

breakdown = score_plan(plan, weights)
print(build_explanation(plan, breakdown))
```

## Tests

```
pytest
```
This repository models the SeaTac â†’ Hood Canal Bridge trip using a few ferry and bridge routing options. The project is structured around reusable travel-time primitives and provides a simple script for evaluating each candidate route.

## Running the analysis

```bash
python scripts/analyze_routes.py
```

The script prints a human-readable summary that highlights the departure and arrival windows, terminal waits, and any slack risks for each itinerary.
